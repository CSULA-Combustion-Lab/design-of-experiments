## ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Simulation options ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ##
# Simulation Types (0D, 1D, Burner)
## 0D Simulates a no flame condition tracking species concentraion in time
## 1D Simulates an adiabatic flame tracking species before, at, and after flame
Simulation_Type: '1D'
Mechanism: 'Shrestha Ammonia.cti' #Mechanism file
Save_files: True # Save files for plotting script
Plot_on_completion: True # Run the plotting script immediately after the simulation.

## ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Mixture options ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ##
Mixture_options:
# Fuel, Oxidizer, and Diluent can either be a single species or mixture
# For multichemical follow structure ['Chemical1', % of Total, ...] or use
# a dictionary.
# The percentage following the chemical name should sum up to 1
    Fuel: 'NH3'
    # Fuel     = ['CH4', .75, 'CO2', .25]
    # Fuel: {'CH4': .75, 'CO2': .25}
    Oxidizer: {'O2': 0.21, 'N2': 0.79}
    Diluent: 'CH4'

# Mixture_type choices:
#  phi_oxi/dil specifies the equivalence ration and oxidizer to diluent ratio
#  phi_fuel/dil specifies the equivalence ration and fuel to diluent ratio
#  phi_fuel specifies the equivalence ratio and fuel mole fraction
#  phi_oxi specifies the equivalence ratio and oxidizer mole fraction
#  phi_dil specifies the equivalence ratio and diluent mole fraction
#  fuel_dil specifies the fuel and diluent mole fractions
#  oxi_dil specifies the oxidizer and diluent mole fractions
#  oxi_fuel specifies the oxidizer and fuel mole fractions
    Mixture_type: 'phi_fuel/dil'

#Parameters
# All parameters are lists of three numbers
# First Number: Initial point
# Second Number: End Point
# Third Number: Number of points. If set to 1 only first point is evaluated
# Mixture parameters. Not all of these will be used, depending on Mixture_type
    Equivalence: [0.2, 5, 10] # Used in mixture types with phi
    fraction_in_oxidizer_or_fuel: [0.1, 0.9, 10] # X / (X+diluent) where X is O2 or fuel. Used for Oxi_dil or Fue_dil
    fuel_fraction: [0.01, 0.5, 15] # % of total mixture. Used in mixture types with fuel
    oxidizer_fraction: [0.01, 0.9, 15] # % of total mixture. Used in mixture types with oxi

# Thermodynamic parameters. P in atm, T in Kelvin
    Pressure: [1, 1, 1]
    Temperature: [300, 500, 1]

# Array_type: 'log' or 'lin', specifying if thermodynamic and mixture
# variables should vary in log- or linear- space
    Array_type: 'lin'

## ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Zero-D simulation options ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ##
ZeroD_options:
    SpecificSpecies: #Species of interest for rxn ranking data
        -  'OH'
    Starttime: 0     # In the case a reading is too early
    Endtime: 0.001 # One milisecond
    Delta_T: 100  # Ignore simulations if T change is larger than this value, indicating a flame.
    threshold: 1e-6 # Ignore measurements below this mole fraction
    Save_time: True # Save time for GUI


## ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Flame simulation options ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ##
Flame_options:
    Mingrid: 200  # Minimum number of grid points in flame.
    Mul_soret: False  # Include multicomponent diffusion and Soret effect?
    Loglevel: 0  # Higher values print more information.

## ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Plotting options ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ##
# Which folder to plot? Ignored if Plot_on_completion is True
# Give a string for the name of the folder, 1, or 2.
# 1: Use the last folder that was analyzed.
# 2: Use the last folder that was simulated
Folder_name: 2

# Reaction numbers of interest.
Rxn_interest: [890]

# Which four independent variables should be plotted?
# Options are 'T', 'F', 'Phi', 'O2', 'Su', 'P', or any species name.
Four_Plot: ['NH3', 'CH4', 'Phi', 'Su']

Min_speed: 0 # Minimum flame speed for plotting, in m/s
Nrxns: 5 # Top n-reactions. Currently only used for flame case.
Threshold: 0.5 # Threshold for rxn_interst to be above in average strength
